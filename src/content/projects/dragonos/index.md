DragonOS is a 64-bit operating system with a completely independent kernel, designed for lightweight cloud computing scenarios, offering Linux binary compatibility. It aims to provide lightweight, high-performance solutions for containerized workloads. Developed using Rust for enhanced reliability.

The DragonOS open-source community was established in July 2022 and is entirely commercially neutral. We warmly welcome interested developers and enthusiasts to join us!

DragonOS features excellent and comprehensive architectural design. Compared to other systems of similar scale, DragonOS supports eBPF and virtualization. Currently, we are actively advancing container support, cloud platform compatibility, RISC-V support, as well as porting compilers and application software. Our goal is to achieve large-scale production environment deployment within five years.

DragonOS is rapidly evolving under community-driven development. Currently, DragonOS has implemented approximately 1/4 of Linux interfaces. In the future, we will provide 100% Linux compatibility along with new features.
