Led the industrial deployment of a vision recognition model for fault detection and part sorting.

**C++ Model Acceleration**: Utilized ONNX Runtime to perform hardware acceleration on pre-trained models, reducing inference latency and achieving real-time sorting.

**Cross-Language Integration**: Created a C++ binary interface for C# client to directly and efficiently deliver image frames, ensuring fast retrieval of the C++ inference results.
